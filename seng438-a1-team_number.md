# Introduction


# An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual functional testing before this lab

Exploratory testing is a manual, human-based approach to software testing. It involves the creation and execution of test values, based on the testers' knowledge of the program. Exploratory testing is unscripted, with no predefined test cases. However, testers should have a clear understanding of how the application is intended to function. 

Manual functional testing is a structured approach where human testers follow predefined test cases to assess software features and functionalities. It provides a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the software's behaviour.


# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The team will first ensure that they have a solid understanding of the system's intended functionality by reviewing the system's high-level requirements. 

Our testing will include card validation, cash withdrawal, deposits, transfers, balance inquiries, transaction logging, error handling, and receipt generation. To ensure comprehensive coverage across a wide range of functionalities, we've divided the testing between two pairs. Each pair will take a balanced approach, testing the defined functionalities moderately, rather than extensively focusing on a few functions. Thus allowing us to cover a broad range of the system's functionality.


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing involves a high-level overview of the system and going through functionality much like a regular user. Exploratory testing is unscripted, the tester will simply test each functionality of the system unambiguously. 

Exploratory testing does have its benefits and tradeoffs. However, one of its benefits is that it is more efficient in testing an entire system quickly, and allows for developers to gain quick feedback on their system. Additionally, testing scenarios unforeseen by the testers for manual scripted testing may have yet to foresee a certain test case that arises organically through unscripted testing. Exploratory testing doesn’t go as in-depth as manual testing as it’s far less vigorous. And so, generally speaking, exploratory testing should only be used as an initial starting point with manual scripted testing.

On the other hand, manual scripted testing involves having a set of predefined test cases to be tested against a system. These test cases are typically quite extensive and aim to test each portion of a system in depth to find any bugs.

Manual functional testing does have its benefits and tradeoffs as well when compared to exploratory testing. Manual functional testing is not as efficient, requiring extensive tests of functionality that all must be documented. However, due to the more robust structure of manual functional testing, tests can be reproduced easily and greater code coverage is accomplished as opposed to exploratory testing alone. However, when creating these test cases, developers may not consider some of the edge cases that may lead to bugs. 

So while generally manual functional testing is better on its own, it's important to note that each can help serve one another and provide better system coverage. On the one hand, exploratory testing helps to gain quick feedback on a system and potentially highlight unconsidered edge cases at the cost of less code coverage. On the other hand, manual functional testing is far more time-consuming, but as a result, better-documented tests are produced which cover far more code functionality than exploratory testing does.


# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Before testing, we discussed and agreed on a defect report format to ensure consistency. After our initial exploratory testing, discussing defects was straightforward thanks to the established format.


# How the pair testing was managed and teamwork/effort was divided 

The key lesson from our teamwork was the importance of clear communication to ensure everyone was on the same page before moving forward. This helped each team member understand their role and contributed to an efficient workflow. 


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The lab was straightforward. Our group took deliberate steps to review the manual and ensure everyone was prepared before testing. Discussing and dividing the tasks in advance was essential for the successful and efficient completion of the lab.


# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

Some of the provided test cases for Manual Testing were unclear, particularly those related to PIN entry.
